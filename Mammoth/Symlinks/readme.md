Executing the create_symlinks script, with the modified .bashrc file in place,
will create symbolic links to scripts we wish to regularly use from anywhere.

This allows us to run commands without referencing the path to the script.
- e.g. instead of /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/AWS/syncaws
- we can use: syncaws
