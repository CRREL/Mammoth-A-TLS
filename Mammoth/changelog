  - Added 2nd compress and sync script calls into crontab.  Upload size was too
  large to complete before next scans would need to be conducted.  Now compressing
  and syncing to aws s3 bucket at 1:08 a.m./p.m. and 1:38 a.m./p.m., respectively.

  - Ran sudo dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest to get rid of cronjob emails to
  the root user mail account relating to being unable to open /etc/popularity-contest.conf


11/19/2020:
  - Changed first extended line scan to occur 6 minutes after the hour instead of 5.
  This is due to a dropped extended line scan due to a spectralon panel scan not being
  entirely finished with the scanner.

  - Updated uploads to 10 min after the hour, instead of 9, to adjust for extended line
  scans occuring 1 minute later at the top of the hour.

12/21/2020:
  - Added a spectralon-gondola line scan into the line scan script.
  - bumped the extended line scan from 6 minutes after the hour to 7 minutes after the hour, to accommodate for the additional line scan.
