  - Added 2nd compress and sync script calls into crontab.  Upload size was too
  large to complete before next scans would need to be conducted.  Now compressing
  and syncing to aws s3 bucket at 1:08 a.m./p.m. and 1:38 a.m./p.m., respectively.

  - Ran sudo dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest to get rid of cronjob emails to
  the root user mail account relating to being unable to open /etc/popularity-contest.conf
