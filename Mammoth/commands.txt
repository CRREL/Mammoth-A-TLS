To view archived mail logs:
  - from mammoth home: cd /Mammoth/Logs
  - change directories to view file names of existing archive logs, using cd
  - use nano or vim to view root or mammoth user account mail logs

** If you wish to test functions of the A-TLS system, you must log into the
root user account.  The scheduled tasks are only conducted from the root crontab
and thus, if trying to execute scripts from the mammoth user account the paths
will not be correct.  These scripts are automated from the perspective of the
root crontab, thus, we must replicate that to test scripts. **

sudo su -l root
  - Frame Scan:
    - Does not require you to turn on the scanner first, it is built into the script.
    - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Scans/frame
    - if it is snowing, it will call the line script
    - if it is not snowing, it will turn off the scanner.
    - Remember these scripts are meant to be automated, not user tools.

  - Line Scan:
    - Requires you to turn on the scanner first as it is always called from frame during automation
    - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/GPIO/scanner_poweron
    - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Scans/line
    - Line does not turn off the scanner, so you must call the scanner_poweroff script.
    - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/GPIO/scanner_poweroff

  - Extended Line Scan:
    - snowing variable must equal 1 in order for an extended line scan to be conducted.
    - to set snowing = 1:
      - echo 1>/home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Vars/snowing
    - Does not require you to turn on the scanner first, it is built into the script.
    - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Scans/line_extended

    - remember to set snowing = 0 when done:
      - echo 0>/home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Vars/snowing
