To view archived mail logs:
  - from mammoth home: cd /Mammoth/Logs
  - change directories to view file names of existing archive logs, using cd
  - use nano or vim to view root or mammoth user account mail logs

** If you wish to test functions of the A-TLS system, you must log into the
root user account.  The scheduled tasks are only conducted from the root crontab
and thus, if trying to execute scripts from the mammoth user account the paths
will not be correct.  These scripts are automated from the perspective of the
root crontab, thus, we must replicate that to test scripts. **

** If Symlinks has been installed you do not need to provide pathing to execute scripts **

- Frame Scan:
 - Does not require you to turn on the scanner first, it is built into the script.
  - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Scans/frame
  - If Symlinks are installed just use: frame
  - if it is snowing, it will call the line script
  - if it is not snowing, it will turn off the scanner.
  - Remember these scripts are meant to be automated, not user tools.

- Line Scan:
  - Requires you to turn on the scanner first as it is always called from frame during automation
  - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/GPIO/scanner_poweron
  - If Symlinks are installed just use: sudo scanner_poweron
  - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Scans/line
  - If Symlinks are installed just use: line
  - Line does not turn off the scanner, so you must call the scanner_poweroff script.
  - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/GPIO/scanner_poweroff
  - If Symlinks are installed just use: sudo scanner_poweroff

- Extended Line Scan:
  - snowing variable must equal 1 in order for an extended line scan to be conducted.
  - to set snowing = 1:
    - echo 1 >/home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Vars/snowing
  - Does not require you to turn on the scanner first, it is built into the script.
  - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Scans/line_extended
  - If Symlinks are installed just use: line_extended
  - Turns off the scanner after the scan has finished being conducted.
  - remember to set snowing = 0 when done:
    - echo 0 >/home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Vars/snowing

- Manual Scanner Power On:
  - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/GPIO/scanner_poweron
  - If Symlinks are installed just use: sudo scanner_poweron

- Manual Scanner Power Off:
  - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/GPIO/scanner_poweroff
  - If Symlinks are installed just use: sudo scanner_poweroff

- To view current month's mail log:
  - nano /var/mail/mammoth
  - nano /var/mail/root

- To convert .rxp to .rxp.gz and .laz
  - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/Scans/compress
  - If Symlinks are installed just use: compress

- To upload .rxp.gz and .laz files to the AWS S3 Bucket:
  - make sure to run the compress script first.
  - /home/mammoth/Mammoth/Scripts/AWS/syncaws
  - If Symlinks are installed just use: syncaws
